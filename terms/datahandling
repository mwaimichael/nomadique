Kenya's Data Protection Act (DPA) of 2019 mandates lawful, fair, and transparent handling of personal data, requiring consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, security, and data subject rights (access, correction, deletion). 
Organizations must protect data, notify subjects about processing, ensure data isn't transferred internationally without safeguards, and comply with Office of the Data Commissioner (ODPC) guidelines, facing penalties for breaches, say MMW Advocates LLP and CMS Law.
