For large, impactful African datasets, focus on platforms like Opendataforafrica.org, openAFRICA, and Zindi for context-specific data <health, agriculture, finance>, plus Datum Africa and specialized portals like the Africa-geoportal <geospatial> and African language data repositories <e.g., for NER>. Look for data from the African Development Bank, World Bank, and sensors.AFRICA for broad economic, environmental, and real-time data.
